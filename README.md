# Problem Description:
Our project involves modeling and developing a relational database to represent the operations of Procter & Gamble (P&G), a leading global consumer goods company. The core entity in our model is the Product, representing the various goods P&G manufactures and distributes across different markets. Each product is tied to a specific Brand (such as Tide, Pampers, or Gillette) and falls under a broader Category (like household items or personal care). P&G collaborates with various Suppliers that provide essential raw materials, as well as Retailers that sell the products to consumers. The company also runs marketing Campaigns to promote products and brands across different regions and target audiences. Our aim is to accurately model these relationships, create sample data, and populate the entities accordingly. In addition, we will perform queries on this data to extract valuable business insights, such as product sales performance, supply chain efficiency, and the impact of marketing efforts.
